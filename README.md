# The EMImR a Shiny Application for Transcriptomic and Epigenomic Changes Identification


## Function
The application's main function is to identify the intersection between genetic and epigenetic modififcations, including :

* Identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
  
* Identify the differentially methylated genes (DMGs)  

* Determine DEGs associated with DMGs
  
* Identify the genes associated to differentially expressed interfering miRNA (GDEImRs).

* Determine DEGs associated with  differentially expressed interfering miRNA 

* Performe Ontology analysis for all gene groups
